This is a project to work on familiarity with HTML/CSS/Devtools

Things I Learned
-Gotta make images display as blocks to move em around
  -margin-left/right default to center
    -margins operate by percentage
  -width stretches an image about its center
-The layer where you apply something is incredibly important
-I should be committing more often
-Box model!
-cropped an image image size, once orientation was right removed overflow
  -used thin border around actual
-used positioning to move nav bar at the top
-margin syntax: TRBL
-Can wrap elements in a div, then use text-align: center to center them

 For future versions
 -make search bar look better, possibly contain real google Logo
 -Clean up buttons
 -make the page fit exactly to a single page
 -squish down footer
